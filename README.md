This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Approach

## Game Creation and Joining (RESTful API)

### Game Creation:

Game leaders can create new games using a RESTful API endpoint.
Generate a unique game code or ID for each game.
Store game details, such as the game code, current question, players, and scores, in a database.

### Game Joining:

Players can join a game by entering the game code or following a link that includes the code as a parameter.
Authenticate players and assign them to the appropriate game session in the database.
Step 2: Real-Time Interactivity (WebSockets)

### WebSocket Setup:

Implement WebSocket server functionality within your application.
Use a WebSocket library like ws to handle WebSocket connections.

### Question Selection:

When a game leader selects a question, send a request to the server via the RESTful API to update the game state.
The server updates the game state and sends a WebSocket message to all participants, notifying them of the new question.

### Answering Questions:

Players can click a button to indicate their intent to answer a question.
When a player clicks to answer, the client sends a WebSocket message to the server with a timestamp.
The server processes these messages, determines the order of clicks based on timestamps, and allows the first player to answer.

### Real-Time Updates:

Use WebSockets to deliver real-time updates, such as question availability, score updates, and game state changes, to all participants.
Push important events like question selection to participants immediately via WebSockets.

### Additional Considerations:

Scalability: Plan for scalability by using load balancing and scaling strategies, especially for WebSocket connections, to handle a large number of concurrent players.

Security: Ensure that WebSocket connections and RESTful API endpoints are secure and that players are properly authenticated and authorized.

Error Handling: Implement error handling for lost WebSocket connections and failed RESTful API requests to provide a smooth user experience.

Persistence: Decide how to handle game state persistence, including storing game state in a database for continued gameplay over multiple sessions.

Frontend Framework: Choose a frontend framework that supports both RESTful API interactions and WebSockets to create a seamless user experience.

Testing: Thoroughly test your game with multiple players to identify and address synchronization, latency, and gameplay issues.

By following this approach, you can build an engaging and interactive online Jeopardy-style game that combines the benefits of RESTful API structure with the real-time responsiveness of WebSockets.
